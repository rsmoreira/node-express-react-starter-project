Create React App

	https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

	It is a tool that helps you to create react apps. So, you will need to install the tool before to start creating react apps with it. 


	Installing the toll

		$ sudo npm install -g create-react-app

	Creating an app

		 Into the root of your project execute the following command:

		 $ create-react-app client

	Starting your recently created React App

		Navigate to the client folder and execute the following command

		$ npm start

		Then, opne your browser on http://localhost:3000 and voiala

	Client vs Server servers

		Right now we have two servers running, our backend (under the root folder, listening to 5000 port) and our new frontend server (the React App recently created, listening to the port 3000). 

		To get the both servers running together you can run both in separate terminals like:

			Terminal_1: 
				Execute the following command under client folder

					$  npm start

			Terminal_2:
				Execute the following command under the root folder (/)

					$ npm run dev

		CONCURRENTLY

			install:

				$ npm install --save concurrently

			Otherwise way you cat get it running through the package "concurrently". The package "concurrently" gives you the ability to have two different servers running under the same command.

			To do that, update the scripts area of your package.json, from the root folder with the following:

				"scripts": {
					"start": "node index.js",
					"server": "nodemon index.js",
					"client": "npm run start --prefix client",
					"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
				}

			So, to get the both servers running together, into the terminal, from the root folder, execute:

				$ npm run dev
